# TSS 2.0 Enhanced System API Rust Wrapper 

[![CI tests](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/rust-tss-esapi/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/rust-tss-esapi/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Continuous+Integration%22)

The `tss-esapi` Rust crate provides an idiomatic interface to the TCG TSS 2.0 Enhanced System API. We expose both direct FFI bindings and abstracted versions, aimed at improved convenience of using the API.

## Requirements

This crate has currently only been tested with the TSS 2.0
[open-source implementation](https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss).
It uses `pkg-config` to find the include and library files for the `tss2-esys` and `tss2-tctildr`
libraries. `pkg-config` tool is needed to build this crate.

Having installed the open-source implementation libraries at `/usr/local/lib` (by default), it
might happen that `pkg-config` can not find them. Run the following command if that is the
case:
```bash
$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
```
